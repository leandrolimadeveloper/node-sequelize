## About 
Project developed in a class about Sequelize with Node.js, produced by the company Rocketseat. In this class was covered concepts of SQL and NoSQL databases, implemented migrations, relationships 1:N and N:N, complex queries and other things.

## Some implementations made by myself:

- [x] Validation to convert all emails registered to lower case
- [x] Use of the iLike operator with operator any
- [x] Resources for updating and deleting an user
